*Update (2018/11/06): [Release 1.0.1 is out](https://github.com/norgeotloic/BakeMyScan/releases/tag/1.0.1), and I'm finishing the website and preparing video tutorials (the one below is just a "placeholder")*

[BakeMyScan](http://bakemyscan.org) is a free blender addon, and aims to provide a fast, powerful and feature-rich toolbox to **efficiently optimize 3D models, scans and sculpts** for use in mobile/WebGL/AR/VR applications and game engines (Unreal/Unity).
