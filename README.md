**BakeMyScan** is a **100% free** blender addon to transform 3D models into "lowpoly" assets for use in Game Engines, WebGL apps or to speed up rendering.

BakeMyScan now has its own website, [bakemyscan.org](http://bakemyscan.org), where you'll find  [installation instructions](http://bakemyscan.org/install) as well as [some tutorials](http://bakemyscan.org/tutorials) and the [last updates on development](http://bakemyscan.org//news).

Do not hesitate to [give me some feedback](http://bakemyscan.org/contact), [signal bugs](https://github.com/norgeotloic/BakeMyScan/issues), or even contribute to the code yourself by forking this repo and [creating pull requests](https://github.com/norgeotloic/BakeMyScan/pulls)!

To support my work, you can also [make a donation](http://bakemyscan.org//donate) (or just say "Hi") - and if you create and share cool stuff thanks to BakeMyScan, citing it would make me really happy, although you don't have to !
