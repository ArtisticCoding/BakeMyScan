# New empty material

This operator is used to select image textures to assign to a material created with the [Empty material](52_empty_material.md) operator.

It will assign a user-selected texture to a specific slot of the material (albedo, roughness, normal, emission...).

Do not forget to change the slot in the bottom-left part of the texture selection dialog, otherwise your textures will always be assigned to the "albedo" slot, which is the default one!

You can check that the selected textures are assigned to the correct slot by viewing the active material in a "Node Editor" window.
