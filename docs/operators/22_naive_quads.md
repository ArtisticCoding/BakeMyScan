# Naive quads
This operator is a first version for a sequence of operations aiming at reproducing a behaviour similar to that of [DynRemesh](https://blendermarket.com/products/dynremesh-1?ref=2).

It currently applies a sequence of "Decimate", "Tris to quads", "Shrinkwrap" and "Subdivision surface" modifiers.

The results are not great at this step, but I'm pretty sure that clean results can easily be achieved through a simple suite of modifiers and mesh operations, which do not seem to justify a 15$ investment according to me.

Let me know if anyone has an idea about it!
